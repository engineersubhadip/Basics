1. `Iterator` Object has 3 properties (`value`, `done` and `next()`).

Using the function `next()` we access the `value` property stores the next value in the collection.

The `done` property tells us if we have / have not consumed all the values in our collection.
If `true` it means all the values are consumed.
If `false` it means the values are still left to be consumed.
