// You are tasked with building a system that interacts with a database. The system needs to perform the following asynchronous operations:

// Query User Data: queryUserData(userId, callback): Queries user data from the database based on the given user ID and calls the callback with the result.

// Query Posts: queryPosts(userId, callback): Queries posts made by a user based on the user ID and calls the callback with the result.

// Query Comments: queryComments(postId, callback): Queries comments for a post based on the post ID and calls the callback with the result.

// Process Data: processData(userData, postsData, commentsData, callback): Processes the queried data and calls the callback with the final result.
