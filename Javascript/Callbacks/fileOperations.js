// You are working on a file processing system. The system needs to perform the following asynchronous tasks:

// Read File: readFile(filePath, callback): Reads the content of a file and calls the callback with the file content.

// Process Data: processData(data, callback): Processes the data read from the file and calls the callback with the processed result.

// Write File: writeFile(filePath, processedData, callback): Writes the processed data to a new file and calls the callback upon completion.
