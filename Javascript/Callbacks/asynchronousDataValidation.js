// You are building a system that validates and transforms user data received from a form submission. The user data includes the user's name, email, and age. The system needs to perform the following tasks asynchronously:

// Validate Name: validateName(name, callback): Validates the user's name and calls the callback with the validation result.

// Validate Email: validateEmail(email, callback): Validates the user's email address and calls the callback with the validation result.

// Validate Age: validateAge(age, callback): Validates the user's age and calls the callback with the validation result.

// Transform Data: transformData(name, email, age, callback): Transforms the validated user data and calls the callback with the transformed result.
