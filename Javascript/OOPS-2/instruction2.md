1. `Class` is a blueprint. And for that blueprint we create an object.

Eg :- `Car` is a blueprint. And using Car whenever we create an object, we get an actual `Car`.

2. Whenever we will call the class `X` with `new` keyword, it will automatically invoke the `constructor` function and the `constructor` function will return the object.
